# To-do-List-TKinter-
A To-Do List project in Python is a simple and common beginner-friendly application that helps users keep track of tasks. The project can have features like adding, deleting, and marking tasks as complete. Here's a breakdown of how you can implement it and what concepts might be useful.

Breakdown of the To-Do List Project:
1. User Interface
The project should start by presenting a menu with options:

Add a new task
View all tasks
Mark a task as complete
Delete a task
Exit the program
2. Basic Structure of the Program
Use a while loop to keep showing the menu until the user decides to exit.
Use if-elif statements to handle different actions based on user input.
3. Data Storage
You can use a list to store the tasks. Each task could be represented as a dictionary with fields like:

Task description
Status (whether completed or not)
